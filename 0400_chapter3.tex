\section{Implementation}
In this chapter, we outline how the five methods for probability density estimation can be implemented on a computer. The main ideas of this chapter were taken, generalized and expanded from \cite{kooperberg1992}. All algorithms were implemented in Python. IN PARTICULAR M NOW CAN BE ANY NUMBER
