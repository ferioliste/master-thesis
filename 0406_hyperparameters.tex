\subsection{Hyperparameter selection}
The algorithms presented rely heavily on the choice on one important hyperparameter, $\lambda_n$, that determines the strength of the regularization induced by the penalty term $J_q(h)$.

While we have requirements on the asymptotic behavior of $\lambda_n$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, for fixed $n$, we are allowed to choose $\lambda_n$ freely. To do so, we use two methods: simple cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation.
