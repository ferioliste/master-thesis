\subsection{Real-world testcase}
In this last section, we present two real-world test cases. We use the \emph{NYC Yellow Taxi Trip} datase from Kaggle\footnote{Dataset available at \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data}{\underline{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data}}}. We consider two variables: the taxi pick-up time and the trip distance. For the pick-up times, we restrict the analysis to the daytime interval from $06{:}00$ to $22{:}00$ and we extract a random subsample of $n=1000$ observations. We make the working assumption that the observations are independent and identically distributed.

Since there are no times during the day in which the demand for taxis is exactly zero, it is reasonable to assume that the corresponding density is bounded away from $0$ and infinity on the considered interval. For this reason, we estimate the pick-up time density using the Simple Maximum Likelihood estimator. We select $\lambda_n=10^{-7}$ using k-fold crossvalidation. The resulting estimate is shown in \autoref{fig:arrival_time_distr}. The fitted density is trimodal: the first peak occurs around $08{:}30$, which coincides with the morning commute; the second peak appears around $14{:}00$, shortly after lunch; and the third peak is around $18{:}30$, when many people return home from work. The density increases again as $22{:}00$ approaches. A distribution of this type can be useful, for instance, to inform decisions on how many taxis should be operating at different times of the day.

We also estimate the distribution of trip distances. We remove trips with distance equal to $0$ and we discard trips longer than $13$ km, since they represent only a small fraction of the data and would dominate the scale of the plot. We select $\lambda_n=10^{-6}$ again using k-fold crossvalidation. The estimated density, shown in \autoref{fig:distance_distr}, is unimodal, with mode around $1$ km.
