     abstract = {Extended linear modeling provides a flexible framework for functional estimation problems with multiple covariates. Such problems include ordinary and generalized regression, density and conditional density estimation, hazard regression, spectral density estimation and polychotomous regression. In this paper, we develop a general theory on the rate of convergence of maximum likelihood estimation in extended linear modeling. The role of concavity of the log-likelihood function is highlighted. Both correctly specified and misspecified models are treated in a unified manner. Applications are made to a variety of structural models: saturated models, partly linear models, and functional ANOVA models. Two specific contexts, counting process regression and conditional density estimation, are used to illustrate the general theory.},

    abstract = { We consider the problem of approximating a function f supposed to be “smooth”, given its values known with error at n different points of a real interval \$[a,b]\$. To approximate f we use the natural smoothing spline of order q and parameter \$\tau \$. For choosing \$\tau \$, the method of generalized cross validation, proposed by Wahba and others, has very interesting theoretical properties, but requires expensive calculations.The asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues associated with the spline functions provides a practical method for calculating the GCV function which reduces the computation time by a factor of n. }

    abstract = {One often wants to estimate statistical models where the probability density function is known only up to a multiplicative normalization constant. Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very difficult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simplifies to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete filter set for natural image data.},

    abstract = {A method of estimating an unknown density function ƒ based on sample data is studied. Our approach is to use maximum likelihood etimation to estimate log(ƒ) by a function s from a space of cubic splines that have a finite number of prespecified knots and are linear in the tails. The knots are placed at selected order statistics of the sample data. The number of knots can be determined either by a simple rule or by minimizing a variant of AIC. Examples using both simulated and real data show that the method works well both in obtaining smooth estimates and in picking up small details. The method is fully automatic and can easily be extended to yield estimates and confidence bounds for quantiles.}
